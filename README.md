### 😱 What are you doing here so early!?
Let me just clean up a few things before you come in—it's not usually this messy! *Just kidding!* You can come in—well... if you took your shoes off I'd appreciate it (I just vacuumed two months ago). Or, you know, you can keep them on, whatever makes you comfortable. I mean—maybe I should put my shoes on while we're at it.

### 👋 About me... 
Okay, that joke is over. Probably wasn't worth it, but hey, you gotta laugh! And now we're doing the "about me" thing. Yeah I mean, let me just spin my wheels for a few more sentences here... "hit the snooze" so to speak. Let's just do one more... and we're good. About me!

### 🛠 What I'm working on...
Alright, so I guess we're just moving on? Whatever. Let me play catch up real quick: my name is [Gus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonesome_Dove#Characters), and I live in the [Twin Cities](https://heggiespizza.com/). I have a [Bachelor of Music in Trombone Performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) from Lawrence University (although I spent a few years in the CS department), and have remained passionate about music since. I've found the pursuit of becoming a better musician to have a lot in common with that of becoming a better engineer. (Okay, now what I'm working on!) I've spent most of the past couple years in the world of full-stack JavaScript, and have developed a love for TypeScript and test-driven practices.

### 🤔 I'm looking for help with...
*I was clearly onto something there, I'm just going to keep going...* At the moment, I've been spending a good deal of time working on a React Native-based app for musicians to create and manage practice routines with my good friend [Luke Rivard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rivardluke/). I've also recently finished my first contribution to [17Lands](https://www.17lands.com/), a web application with a few corresponding desktop applications that aggregates data for players of [Magic The Gathering Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena). I also participated in the [2020 GitHub Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020/rate/839955)

### 💬 Ask me about...
Alright so at this point not only is this getting *much* longer than it should be, the content is two secions off? Honestly, what a train wreck. Let's just wrap a few things up here and call it a wash:

- 💻  Love JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
- 💾  Like Python, C#, and Java.
- 🎺  There's no trombone emoji?
- 🧙‍♂️  I play limited (the correct format) Magic.
