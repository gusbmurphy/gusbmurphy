### 😱 What are you doing here so early!?
Let me just clean up a few things before you come in—it's not usually this messy! *Just kidding!* You can come in—well... if you took your shoes off I'd appreciate it (I just vacuumed two months ago). Or, you know, you can keep them on, whatever makes you comfortable. I mean—maybe I should put my shoes on while we're at it.

- 💻  Love JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
- 💾  Like Python, C#, and Java.
- 🎺  There's no trombone emoji?
- 🧙‍♂️  I play limited (the correct format) Magic.
